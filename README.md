# Catholic Bishops and Twitter

This project answers a number of questions:

- In presidential elections from 2000 through 2024, which presidential candidates won in each diocese, and by what margin?
- How active on Twitter (now X) was the diocesan bishop (as of 2023, the last point at which I could gather data)?
- Is there any correlation between the winner of the election(s) and how active on Twitter the diocesan bishop was?

Note: For the reasons indicated by Patrick O'Connor in his [introduction to county presidential elections](https://www.kaggle.com/code/wumanandpat/county-presidential-elections-an-introduction#gotchas_fips), Alaska is omitted from the analysis.
